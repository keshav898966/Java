This Java program implements a Student Record Management System that runs in a command-line interface. It allows users to manage a list of students by performing common operations such as adding a student, viewing all students, updating existing records, and deleting student records. Each student is represented by an object containing an ID, name, and marks. The core logic is built using object-oriented principles, with the Student class encapsulating student data and the StudentList class handling user interaction and managing the list of students using an ArrayList.

The purpose of this program is to provide a practical example of how CRUD operations can be implemented in Java using core language features. It demonstrates how to build interactive console applications, how to use collections like ArrayList, and how to manage user input using the Scanner class. Exception handling is also used to ensure the application responds gracefully to invalid inputs, making it a useful project for beginners who want to strengthen their understanding of Java programming basics and object-oriented design.
